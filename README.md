Introduction
============
The Java common utilities and datatype management libraries is a set of 
subprojects that are composed of generic utility classes. The objective
of these frameworks is to be compatible with Java 1.4 and in some cases
with CDC so they can be used in older Java environments or embedded Java
environments.

These are the different subprojects included in this project:

* optimasc-commons-cldc Base classes for basic I/O, error management, and 
 character set conversion among others. These use only JSR 218 Java CDC 
 compatible API's.
* optimasc-commons Contains I/O, parsing, text processing and date conversion 
 utilities that can run on Java 1.4 or later JRE's.
* optimasc-datatypes contains basic datatype class representations that can be used
 to represent schemas such as SQL Schemas, XML Schema, ASN1 types or ISO/IEC 11404 general
 purpose datatypes.
