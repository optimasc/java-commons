     <h2>Package overview</h2>

     <p>This package contains classes that can be used to retrieve information from 
     archive formats as well as extract information from archive files. It could
     also be used to represent disk images.</p>
     
     <h2>How to use</h2>
     
     <p>The <code>ArchiveEntry</code> interface is used to represent an entry in an archive file
     or disk file, while the <code>ArchiveFileReader</code> is an abstract implementation 
     of an archive reader that must be implemented for each archive format
     that shall be supported. </p>
     
     <p>The <code>ArchiveEntry</code> interface is similar to <code>org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveEntry</code> interface of Apache common compress.</p>
